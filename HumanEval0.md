# Refute check of HumanEval_0:


For this , we pass a primary base solution which we intend to be the most efficient solution and try to compare the code generations with this.
We evaluate the comparisions based on :
>Readability

>Correctness (Primary : passes doctests , Secondary : Passes all valid inputs according to the base solution)

>Efficiency

>Space complexity

>Stability of the code for various tests and inputs.

We perform this by prompting the two solutions to our primary model and ask it compare according to these benchmarks.


**Test Doctstring:**
```
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
```


We obtain that the docstring is not well defined. If we take into account some assumptions , we arrive at the following base solution against which the code generations can be compared.

**Base Solution:**
```
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for index in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[index + 1] - numbers[index] < threshold:
            return True

```


## Results:

>> 1.py :
>> 
Readability: The use of list comprehensions makes the code less readable compared to the base solution.

Correctness: The solution passes the provided doctests and correctly checks for closeness between distinct elements.

Efficiency: Time complexity is O(n^2) due to nested loops, less efficient than the base solution.

Space Complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, but the list comprehension increases temporary space usage.

Stability: The solution is stable and correctly avoids counting pairs of identical elements.

Readability: The long conditional statements makes the code less readable.

Correctness: The solution correctly checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It passes the provided doctests.

Efficiency: The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, where n is the length of the input list. This is less efficient compared to the base solution.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space, but the list comprehension increases temporary space usage.

Stability: The solution is stable and correctly checks for closeness using the minimum absolute difference.

Readability: The solution is less readable due to the complex list comprehension with nested loops. The use of single-letter variable names (idx_i, val_i, etc.) also hinders readability.

Correctness: The solution correctly checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It passes the provided doctests.

Efficiency: The solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, where n is the length of the input list. This is less efficient compared to the base solution.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space. The list comprehension increases temporary space usage, but it's not stored.

Stability: The solution is stable and correctly checks for closeness using the minimum absolute difference.

>> 8.py :
>>
Readability: The solution is highly readable. It uses zip to iterate over adjacent pairs of sorted numbers, making the code concise and easy to understand.

Correctness: The solution correctly checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It passes the provided doctests.

Efficiency: The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the subsequent loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is more efficient than some previous solutions with nested loops.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space. The sorting is done in place.

Stability: The solution is stable and correctly checks for closeness using the sorted order.
