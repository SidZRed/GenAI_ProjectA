Refute check of HumanEval0:
For this , we pass a primary base solution which we intend to be the most efficient solution and try to compare the code generations with this.
We evaluate the comparisions based on :
>Readability

>Correctness (Primary : passes doctests , Secondary : Passes all valid inputs according to the base solution)

>Efficiency

>Space complexity

>Stability of the code for various tests and inputs.

We perform this by prompting the two solutions to our primary model and ask it compare according to these benchmarks.


Test Doctstring:
```
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
```

Base Solution:
```
from typing import List
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    numbers.sort()
    for index in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[index + 1] - numbers[index] < threshold:
            return True

```
