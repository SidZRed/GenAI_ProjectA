# GenAI_ProjectA

This repository is created to perform refute checks on certain open sourced AI models against HumanEval Benchmarks and test their code generation performance.
We have selected certain open source models from the HumanEval database and test them against the HumanEval codes.


We are currently using a version of the CodeLlama model with 34 Billion parameters which is working at a temperature of 0.2 . 
We test this model's code generations against a primary model, which in this case is GPT-3.5 
We use this to refute the code generations and give feedbacks.
